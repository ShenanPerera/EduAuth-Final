#EDUAUTH
Free and online courses are often disregarded as an actual qualification in the industry. The reason is that the earned certification cannot validated the individual's skill level since the examinations are held online and unsupervised allowing the examinee to commit exam violations such as cheating. EduAuth features an AI-based proctoring system that monitors the user during online exams. This system helps to validate the authenticity of the user and provides a level of assurance to employers, ensuring that the certificates earned through course providers have real value in the job market.
